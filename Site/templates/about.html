       Hi, my name is Tom Hartung and I have been working with web
        technologies since the mid-1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
       WordPress has evolved into one of the most popular tools for
        building websites.
       It is a powerful, well-documented tool supported by a
        wonderfully diverse and very friendly, intelligent,
        hard-working community,
      </p>
      <p class="mdl-card__supporting-text italic underline">
       What if I told you there are other options, that are leaner,
        more efficient and secure, and hence better suited for
        small businesses, startups, non-profits, and solo efforts?
      </p>
      <p>
       On this page I share some of the reasons I have been porting
        my PHP-based WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal sites to use the
        Python-based CMSes Flask and Django.

     Python is a multi-purpose programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
     After an IoT hackathon piqued my interest in Python, I played
      around with it a bit on my Raspberry Pi, then used it to
      replace some of my shell scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The design of the Django and Flask web CMSes is what really
      turned my head, though.
    </p>
    <p class="mdl-card__supporting-text italic">
     Flask and Django sites use a database only if
      one is needed to support the site's business goals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many website security vulnerabilities are due to the
      misuse of a database.
     Hence, a site that does not use a database is much more
      secure than a site that uses one.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is especially true if the site uses an open-source
      database &mdash; because it has an open and
      well-known structure.
    </p>
    <p class="mdl-card__supporting-text">
     Python is growing in popularity because it enables
      writing concise code that can be easily understood
      and maintained by beginners and experienced programmers alike.

     Material Design is a design language developed by Google in 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
     I first learned about Material Design in a meetup.
     Its goal is to use paper as a paradigm for giving applications on
      all devices a consistent look and feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I recently had the opportunity to create a new site
      from scratch, I decided to give it a try.
     I quickly decided to update my existing python-based sites
      to use it as well.
    </p>
    <p class="mdl-card__supporting-text italic">
     Material Design CSS packages make it
      easy to use it on websites.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Portfolio page on this site showcases sites using
      a variety of Material Design CSS packages.
    </p>
    <p>
     These packages are new and change rapidly, so take this next
      statement with a grain of salt:
     At this time, in January of 2019, I like Material Design Bootstrap
      the best, Material Design Lite the least, and put Materialize
      and MUI-CSS in between.

     Some people want quick-and-dirty results, but are afraid to admit
      they are not interested in quality work.
     I call quick-and-dirty work <q>prototyping.</q>
     If you are cool with me cutting corners, call it <q>prototyping,</q>

     It's a cinch to move it to wordpress, react, drupal, or whatever later,
      if that's what you decide you want to do.

     I feel like sometimes people would rather see quick results than

     A database can be helpful when building a general-purpose tool.
     The downside is it can present a serious security risk.
     Hackers know this, and they have tools for finding bloated sites
      running out-dated vulnerable software.
