# joomoowebsites.com-flask

Replacing the joomla site with flask.  Time to move on.

# Goal

- Very simple site
- Flask and MUI

# Content

- "Simple Sites Built With Python and Material Design"
- Target - possibly on home page, possibly under the fold:
  - Small business
  - Looking for more than Wix
  - Not wanting to use WP for some reason
    - Concerned about security
    - It is frequently overkill
  - Want a shiny new MD look
- Pricing - possibly on home page, possibly under the fold:
  - Value-based
  - Weekly invoice or half up front
  - Incremental, frequent deliveries and corresponding payments
- Portfolio: page listing other Python + MD sites
- Legal pages
- About section?
  - Keep it minimal
  - Maybe include photo of JooMoo Tree?
  - Maybe just point to tomwhartung.com?
